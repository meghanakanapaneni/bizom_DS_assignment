Methods tried:
1. Method 1
   -Trained for 10 epochs
   -Forward pass model 1, forward pass model 2, backpropagate model 2, back propagate model 1
   -Training Accuracy model 1 - 91.12%,Validation Accuracy model 1: 91.92%
2. Method 2
   -Model 1 trained for 10 epochs, Model 2 trained for 1000 epochs
   -Forward pass model 1, forward pass model 2, backpropagate model 2 ,train model 2 for 100 epochs, back propagate model 1
   -It has a better performance with model 2 but taking a lot and time and model 2 is converging in 3 or 4 epochs.
   Observations:
   -Training model 2 for more epochs improves accuracy.
3. Method 3
   - Trained for 10 epochs
   - Forward pass model 1, forward pass model 2, backpropagation both losses together i.e., summation of losses
   - Accuracy is poor compartively
